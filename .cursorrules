# Project Rules for Rematch Balancer

## Database Migrations

When creating database changes:
1. Create new file in `supabase/migrations/` with format: `00X_description.sql`
2. Use next available number (check README)
3. Always use `IF EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
4. Update the migrations/README.md table
5. Test the migration before committing

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer server components, use "use client" only when needed
- Keep components small and focused
- Use Tailwind for styling (no custom CSS unless needed)

## Supabase Best Practices

- Always use RLS policies
- Use typed queries with TypeScript
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use `upsert` for create-or-update operations
